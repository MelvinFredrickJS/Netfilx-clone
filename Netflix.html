                        To cancel your Netflix subscription, you can follow these steps:

                        1. **Sign In**: Go to the Netflix website (www.netflix.com) and sign in with your account
                        credentials.

                        2. **Account Settings**: Once logged in, hover over your profile icon in the top right corner of
                        the Netflix homepage and click on "Account" from the dropdown menu. This will take you to your
                        Account Settings page.

                        3. **Membership & Billing**: On the Account Settings page, you will find a section called
                        "Membership & Billing." Here, you'll see a link that says "Cancel Membership." Click on this
                        link.

                        4. **Confirm Cancellation**: Netflix will prompt you with a message explaining the details of
                        your current plan and the date your account will officially close. Click on "Finish
                        Cancellation" to confirm.

                        5. **Confirmation Email**: You should receive a confirmation email from Netflix to the email
                        address associated with your account, confirming the cancellation.

                        It's important to note that once you cancel your subscription, you will continue to have access
                        to Netflix until the end of your current billing period. After that, your account will no longer
                        be charged, and you won't have access to Netflix content unless you resubscribe.

                        If you have any trouble cancelling your subscription online, you can also contact Netflix
                        customer service directly for assistance.
